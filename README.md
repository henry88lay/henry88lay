### Hi InternetðŸ˜Ž! My name is Henry,

I'm a Software & DevOps Engineer at DX@Scale within Accenture where I spend half my time building developer tools for Salesforce Developers and the other half building and optimising CI/CD pipelines for Salesforce Projects at scale.

And collectively that time is spent understanding problem sets and ideating software solutions around the problem.
